                    <p>
                        There are only 3 different units in mechanics:
                    </p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>
                            <b>Meter</b> &ndash; Unit of Length
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            It is equal to 1 650 763,73 wave lengths of the krypton isotope
                            Kr<sup>86</sup> as it emits light in a vacuum, its atoms transitioning
                            from state <i>5d</i> to state <i>2p</i>.
                            <br/>
                            1 meter is approximately 1/40 000 000th of an Earth's meridian's 
                            length. It is divided into 100 centimeters and 1000 millimeters, 1000
                            meters are a single kilometer.
                        </dd>

                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            It is the mass of a little widget kept in the French National archive.
                            The mass of this little widget is approximately equal to 1
                            dm<sup>3</sup> water weight at 4°C temperature. 1000 kilograms are a
                            single ton and 1000 grams are a kilogram.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>
                            <b>Second</b> &ndash; Unit of Time
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            It is the duration that the cesium isotope Cs<sup>133</sup> atoms take
                            to emit radiation for 9&nbsp;192&nbsp;631&nbsp;770 periods, in their
                            transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state.

                    <p>
                        This is the &ldquo;SI&rdquo; system. Every other possible measurement can
                        be expressed in these three units.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Some people think that there are such units as &ldquo;inches&rdquo; and
                        &ldquo;ounces&rdquo;. These, in fact, are totally fake made up units. Using
                        them is akin to believing in astrology or economics. Anyone who purports to
                        use them is a lunatic. Disregard anything they say.

                                        If someone in France decided to shave off some bits off of the
                                        kilogram, all of the scales in the world would suddenly be
                                        incorrect. It's almost as if there is some kind of a conspiracy.

                        <b>Force</b> is the thing you do when you push a thing or squeeze a thing. It is
                        measured in <b>newtons</b> (N). They can be exerted directly (like punching
                        someone in the face) or by a distance (like hurting someones feelings).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A single <b>newton</b> is the force necessary to accelerate an object with a mass
                        of 1 kg by 1 m/s<sup>2</sup> speed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The unit of pressure is a <b>pascal</b> (Pa) and it is equal to one newton
                        per meter squared (N/m<sup>2</sup>).

                                        The pascal measurement unit is different from Pascal, the
                                        programming language, and Pascal, the guy who invented
                                        said programming language. This distinction will be crucial
                                        later, when we'll be writing simulation programs in Pascal.

                    <p>
                        If you haven't noticed by now, then measurements are basically numbers with
                        a couple letters attached to them. Physicians like to pretend otherwise.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Usually you don't write the letters in equations, though. You just write the
                        number part.
