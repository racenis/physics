                    <p>
                        If you have ever used <i>mspaint</i> or other drawing program, you know 
                        that you can see two numbers changing as you move the mouse cursor.
                        Usually the first number is the <i>x</i> coordinate and
                        the second is the <i>y</i> coordinate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These two numbers together uniquely identify the position of the mouse
                        cursor on the screen. The numbers themselves express a length against
                        a <b>dimension</b>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In real life there are three dimensions, the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>
                        dimensions, but since a computer monitor or a paper page is two-dimensional
                        and flat, we only need two of them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The coordinates were invented by this guy called Descartes, aka Big D in
                        1637. For this achievement, the field of cartography was named after him,
                        since it heavily uses coordinates.

                                        In addition to the dimensions of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
                                        and <i>z</i> there is also a <i>t</i> or time dimension.
                                        If you align your chakras right and open your third eye,
                                        you can freely drop it from equations, as it
                                        becomes irrelevant.

                    <p>
                        Usually you depict the dimensions as little arrows on paper. These arrows
                        are the <b>axii</b>. You can find the coordinate of a point by drawing a
                        line perpendicular to an axis from a point to that axis.

                        A coordinate can represent a point, a vector or basically any other
                        thing that you want. The possibilities are literally endless.
